# Regex Tutorial: Matching an Email

The following tutorial walks the user through using a regex (regular expression) that matches email addresses.

## Summary

A regular expression (regex) is "a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, (The Coding Train, 2.1: Introduction to Regular Expressions, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DG3kCDx53c)." They're mostly useful for defining a search pattern within a body of text. This tutorial will cover a regular expression used to search for email addresses within a body of text.
